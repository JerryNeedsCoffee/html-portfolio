<h2>My Top 3 Anime Of 2024 So Far</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Shingeki no Kyojin</h3>
<p>Shingeki no Kyojin absolutely blew me 
away with it's brilliant writing, character development and foreshadowing. 
It really is one of the greatest shows in my opinion. Each arc had me at the edge of my seat, 
even had me making my own predictions for what would happen! Without spoiling anything, 
it had a bitter-sweet ending but I can say that it was satisfactory. 10/10, strong recommend.</p>

<h3>2. Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2</h3>
<p>"You are my special" Yeah, that opening is stuck inside everyone's heads after watching season 2
    of JJK. It's a completely different tone and vibe from the first season. It was true to the manga 
    and honestly was great to see animated. Again, I'm not going to spoil anything, but I have read a 
    little bit of the manga to see what happens and oh boy, season 3 is going to be lit.</p>

<h3>3. Kimetsu no Yaiba</h3>
<p>The truth is, I had no intention of starting this anime, but a friend recommended it to me and now 
    I want to get to the latest episode! I'm only two episodes in to season 1 at the time of writing 
    this, which kind of makes writing this short review irrelevant, but it really is good so far. 
    Looking forward to completing it!</p>
